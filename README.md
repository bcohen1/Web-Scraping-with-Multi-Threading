# Multi-Threaded-Web-Scraping

As an avid biopharmaceutical investor, I am always looking for new investment opportunities and therefore need to be up to date on what companies are doing. The challenge with finding new investment opportunities, particularly with small-caps where things can move fast, is where to start looking. I developed this script to scrape all of the NASDAQ biopharmaceutical company descriptions from Yahoo Finance and flag key words to help identify potential investment opportunities. To expedite the process of performing ~500 http requests, I implemented multi-threading to greatly reduce the run-time from approximately 30 minutes to just over a minute!
